##### Packages that we have not forked but are locked to a specific commit

# GitPython
#Upstream: https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython
-e git://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython.git@0b820e617ab21b372394bf12129c30174f57c5d7#egg=GitPython

#### Packages that we've forked and cannot converge with upstream

# SpiffWorkflow
#   Upstream: https://github.com/knipknap/SpiffWorkflow
#   Notes:    Some of our changes have been pushed upstream but not in a
#             while. There have been other changes to upstream that aren't
#             compatible with our changes.
-e git://github.com/checkmate/SpiffWorkflow.git#egg=SpiffWorkflow

##### Rackspace client packages that have been abandoned because of pyrax. We
#     have forked and modified these in some way.

# python-cloudfiles
#   Upstream: https://github.com/rackerlabs/python-cloudfiles
#   Notes:    python-cloudfiles is deprecated. The upstream README says that
#             it is going to be unavailable after 8/1/2013. Our only difference
#             has been the ability to write metadata to a container. Caleb's
#             fork has this feature merged in with upstream.

# openstack.compute
#   Upstream: https://github.com/jacobian/openstack.compute
#   Notes:    This project is stale. The last commit is over two years old.
#             We're only using this code base in
#             providers/rackspace/compute_legacy.py. Our additions were small
#             (2 commits) and can be reviewed at
#             https://rax.io/openstack-compute-diff

# pyrax - mailgun
# Upstream: https://github.com/naterh/pyrax.git
# Notes: 	This is the initial add for the mailgun module.  This should be
#			integrated into pyrax shortly and can be removed.
