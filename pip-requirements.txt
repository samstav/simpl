##### Packages that we have not forked but are locked to a specific commit

# GitPython
#Upstream: https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython
-e git://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython.git@0b820e617ab21b372394bf12129c30174f57c5d7#egg=GitPython

# python-clouddb
#   Upstream: https://github.com/slizadel/python-clouddb
#   Note:     This project is stale but maintained by a Racker. We had an
#             internal fork but we've pushed everything back upstream.
#             python-clouddb would end up being ".01", but that is not valid
#             (with a leading ".") so we exclude it here.

#### Packages that we've forked and cannot converge with upstream

# SpiffWorkflow
#   Upstream: https://github.com/knipknap/SpiffWorkflow
#   Notes:    Some of our changes have been pushed upstream but not in a
#             while. There have been other changes to upstream that aren't
#             compatible with our changes.
-e git://github.com/checkmate/SpiffWorkflow.git#egg=SpiffWorkflow

# TODO(any): remove as dep is satisfied with pyrax
# python-novaclient
#  Upstream: https://github.com/openstack/python-novaclient
#  Notes:    python-novaclient is actively developed (3-11 commits/week). Our
#            changes are minimal but are based on a version of
#            python-novaclient that hasn't been patched in a year. We have
#            added the following code: https://rax.io/python-novaclient-diff
#-e git://github.com/checkmate/python-novaclient.git@master#egg=python-novaclient-2012.2


##### Rackspace client packages that have been abandoned because of pyrax. We
#     have forked and modified these in some way.

# python-clouddns
#   Upstream: https://github.com/rackerlabs/python-clouddns.
#   Notes:    Upstream is unmaintained. There are six open pull requests
#             currently, including two that originated from us.
#             Version would end up being 0.0.0, which appears to be ignored by
#             pip/setup.py, so we exclude it here.
-e git://github.com/checkmate/python-clouddns.git#egg=python-clouddns

# python-cloudlb
#   Upstream: https://github.com/rackerlabs/python-cloudlb
-e git://github.com/rackerlabs/python-cloudlb.git@641e6728d049ad6b823895b2034d9bef6d5416de#egg=python-cloudlb

# python-cloudfiles
#   Upstream: https://github.com/rackerlabs/python-cloudfiles
#   Notes:    python-cloudfiles is deprecated. The upstream README says that
#             it is going to be unavailable after 8/1/2013. Our only difference
#             has been the ability to write metadata to a container. Caleb's
#             fork has this feature merged in with upstream.

# openstack.compute
#   Upstream: https://github.com/jacobian/openstack.compute
#   Notes:    This project is stale. The last commit is over two years old.
#             We're only using this code base in
#             providers/rackspace/compute_legacy.py. Our additions were small
#             (2 commits) and can be reviewed at
#             https://rax.io/openstack-compute-diff
-e git://github.com/calebgroom/openstack.compute.git@c870e94cf53f0d5b76889d0c8ece22e9da356e65#egg=openstack.compute-2.0a1
