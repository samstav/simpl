    """Execute a shell command (containing no shell operators) locally.

    If 'command' is a string, it will be split into args to be passed
    to Popen. If 'command' is a list, it will be passed to Popen as is.

    Returns the output from the command.

    Raises SimplCalledProcessError on any non-zero exit status unless
    an OSError (a common error when attempting Popen calls) is raised.

    :param command:         shell command to be executed. if the value is
                            a string, it will be split using shlex.split()
                            to return a shell-like syntax as a list. if the
                            value is a list, it will be passed directly to
                            popen.
    :param cwd:             The working directory will be changed
                            to `cwd` before the command is executed. Note
                            that this directory is not considered when
                            searching the executable, so you can't specify
                            the program's path relative to this argument.
                            Value should not be quoted or shell escaped,
                            since it is passed directly to os.chdir() by
                            subprocess.Popen

                            SimplCalledProcessError

    Notes:
    In this function, Popen is called with stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, which
    sends all stderr to stdout.
