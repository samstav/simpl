'''Decorator to quickly add statsd (graphite) instrumentation to Celery
task functions.

With some slight modification, this could be used to instrument just
about any (non-celery) function and be made abstract enough to customize
metric names, etc.

Stats reported include number of times the task was accepted by a worker
(`started`), the number of successes, and the number of times the task
raised an exception. In addition, it also reports how long the task took
to complete. Usage:

>>> @task
>>> @instrument_task
>>> def mytask():
>>>     # do stuff
>>>     pass

Please note that the order of decorators is important to Celery. See
http://ask.github.com/celery/userguide/tasks.html#decorating-tasks
for more information.

Uses `simple_decorator` from
http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary#Property_Definition

Limitation: Does not readily work on subclasses of celery.tasks.Task
because it always reports `task_name` as 'run'

    Original docstring:
    This decorator can be used to turn simple functions
    into well-behaved decorators, so long as the decorators
    are fairly simple. If a decorator expects a function and
    returns a function (no descriptors), and if it doesn't
    modify function attributes or docstring, then it is
    eligible to use this. Simply apply @simple_decorator to
    your decorator and it will automatically preserve the
    docstring and function attributes of functions to which
    it is applied.
